# EtherView 

EtherView is a collection of tools that can be used to 
interact with the Ethereum emulator. It has the following
features:

- Viewing the balances for all the accounts

- Viewing blocks and transactions (like EtherScan)

- Viewing (or visualizing) interesting blockchain properties, such as
  - base fee
  - transaction pools on each node 

- Viewing POA/POS related information, especially POS.

- Sample dApps. We should host some open-source dApps. Each dApp
  is built into a container. They can be included when the emulator
  is built. When EtherView detects it, the corresponding menu
  will appear, leading us to the dApp. More thinking is needed
  for this feature.
