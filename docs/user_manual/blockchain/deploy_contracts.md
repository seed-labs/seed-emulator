# Deploy Smart Contract 

When we build a blockchain emulator, it is quite common that
we want some smart contracts to be deployed automatically
once the emulator starts. We also need to know the address
of the deployed contract.  During the build time, the blockchain
has not started yet, so we cannot carry out the deployment.
What we need is to set up the deployment on some nodes,
so when the emulator starts, the contract can be deployed 
automatically. This document shows how to do this.

Will wait until we finish the initialization server before
starting to write this document.
