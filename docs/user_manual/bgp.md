## BGP Peering Using Route Server

```
ebgp.addRsPeer(100, 150)
ebgp.addRsPeers(100, [150, 151])
```

The `Ebgp::addRsPeer` and `Ebgp::addRsPeers` calls take two parameters; the first is an internet
exchange ID, and the second is ASN or a list of ASNs. 
They will configure the peering between the
given ASN(s) and the given internet exchange's route server (i.e., setting up
Multi-Lateral Peering Agreement (MLPA)). Note that the session with RS will
always be `Peer` relationship.

The eBGP layer sets up peering by looking for the router node of the given
autonomous system from within the internet exchange network. So as long as
there is a router of that AS in the exchange network (i.e., joined the IX with
`as15X_router.joinNetwork('ix100')`), the eBGP layer should be able to set up
the peeing.

## BGP Private Peering

```
# Create a private peering between AS150 and AS151 inside IX100
ebgp.addPrivatePeering(100, 150, 151, abRelationship = PeerRelationship.Provider)
```

The `Ebgp::addPrivatePeering` call takes four parameters; internet exchange ID,
first ASN, the second ASN, and the relationship. The relationship parameter
defaults to `Peer`. The call will configure peering between the two given ASNs
in the given exchange. 

The peering relationship can be one of the followings:

- `PeerRelationship.Provider`: The first ASN is considered as the upstream
  provider of the second ASN. The first ASN will export all routes to the
  second ASN, and the second ASN will only export its customers' and its own
  prefixes to the first ASN. In this type of peering, the second AS is considered
  as the customer of the first one, and the routes coming from the second AS
  will be marked as the customer routes. 

- `PeerRelationship.Peer`: The two ASNs are considered as peers. Both sides
  will only export their customers and their own prefixes. However, when A exports 
  its routes to B through this type of peering, B will not mark A's routes 
  as its customer routers, and therefore will not further export them to 
  another peer C, unless B and C peers using the `Unfiltered` type (see the following item). 

- `PeerRelationship.Unfiltered`: Make both sides export all routes to each other.


The eBGP layer sets up peering by looking for the router node of the given
autonomous system from within the internet exchange network. So as long as
there is a router of that AS in the exchange network (i.e., joined the IX with
`as15X_router.joinNetworkByName('ix100')`), the eBGP layer should be able to
setup peeing just fine.

## Peer Relationship

The following diagram helps explain how routes are exported for three types of peering. The diagram shows how the `AS150` export its routes to its peers of various types, 
including upsteam providers (`AS150` is on the customized side of a `PeerRelationship.Provider` peering), 
downstream customers (`AS151` is on the provider side), `PeerRelationship.Peer` peers,
and `PeerRelationship.Unfiltered` peers.

## Special BGP Router: Connecting to the Real World

We show how to allow the nodes inside an emulator to communicate
with the machines on the real Internet. A complete example
can be found [here](../../examples/basic/A03_real_world/).
To achieve this goal, we first need to create 
a BGP router to announce the real-world network 
prefixes inside the emulator, so the packets going to the 
real Internet can be routed to this BGP router. 
The routing on this router is set up specially, so packets
going to the real Internet can be routed out (via NAT).  
Responses from the outside will come back to this router
and be routed to the final destination in the emulator.
The following example shows how to create a real-world 
router to connect the emulated world with the real world. 


```python
autosys = base.createAutonomousSystem(11872)
router = autosys.createRealWorldRouter(name='real-world')
router.joinNetwork('ix101', address = '10.101.0.118')
```

The `createRealWorldRouter()` API takes three parameters:

- `name`: name of the node.
- `hideHops`: enable hide hops feature. When `True`, the router will hide real
  world hops from traceroute. This works by setting TTL = 64 to all real world
  destinations on `POSTROUTING`. Default to `True`.
- `prefixes`: list of prefix or `None` (default). 

When the `prefixes` is set to `None` (default), the router will automatically 
fetch the list of prefixes announced by the autonomous system in the real world. 
In the example above, `11872` belongs to the Syracuse University, so
this BGP router will announce the network prefixes belonging to the 
Syracuse University (`128.230.0.0/16`). Other networks are not 
reachable from this BGP router. 

If we want to create a BGP router that can reach all the nodes on the Internet,
we can provide the following IP prefixes, which covers the entire IPV4 space, 
i.e., this BGP router will announce to the emulator that it can reach 
the entire Internet.

```python
autosys.createRealWorldRouter(name='real-world', prefixes=['0.0.0.0/1', '128.0.0.0/1'])
```
